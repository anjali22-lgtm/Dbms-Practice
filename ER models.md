ER MODELS
-The ER stands for entity relationship models is a conceptual models for designing databases. This models represents the logical structure of database includes entities,attributes and realtionship between them.
.Entity: An object that is stored as data such as person name,age etc
.Attributes: Properties that describe the entities
.Relationship: A connection between entities called as "student enroll" in course

ER MODELS

1.ENTITY:  STRONG , WEAK 


2.ATTRIBUTES : KEY, COMPOSITE,MULTIVALUED,DERIVED


3.RELATIONSHIP: ONE TO ONE, ONE TO MANY, MANY TO ONE, MANY TO MANY


How to Draw an ER Diagram
Identify Entities: The very first step is to identify all the Entities. Represent these entities in a Rectangle and label them accordingly.
Identify Relationships: The next step is to identify the relationship between them and represent them accordingly using the Diamond shape. Ensure that relationships are not directly connected to each other.
Add Attributes: Attach attributes to the entities by using ovals. Each entity can have multiple attributes (such as name, age, etc.), which are connected to the respective entity.
Define Primary Keys: Assign primary keys to each entity. These are unique identifiers that help distinguish each instance of the entity. Represent them with underlined attributes.
Remove Redundancies: Review the diagram and eliminate unnecessary or repetitive entities and relationships.
Review for Clarity: Review the diagram make sure it is clear and effectively conveys the relationships between the entities.
